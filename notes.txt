flashcard[0]
  question s = 1 x 0 = ?
  answer s = 0
flashcard[1]
  question s = 1 x 1 = ?
  answer s = 1
flashcard[2]
  question s = 1 x 2 = ?
  answer s = 2

produces:

{
  "flashcard": [
    {
      "question": "1 x 0 = ?",
      "answer": "0"
    },
    {
      "question": "1 x 1 = ?",
      "answer": "1"
    },
    {
      "question": "1 x 2 = ?",
      "answer": "2"
    }
  ]
}

ok, so I want to hit this url:

http://adamweisman.com/flashcards/

with a post request, made up of this json:
{
  "question": "1 x 0 = ?",
  "answer": "0"
 }

that should map to your POST /flashcards route.
you save a new flashcard.
I will send you 100 of these in a loop to build the complete multiplication table set.

Then, I will send another request:
ie:
http://adamweisman.com/flashcards?limit=3
this should return 3 random flashcards from the pool that was saved earlier.
the url is based on: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5020704/how-to-design-restful-search-filtering
(the format of this url to limit the returned number is up for debate.)

The format of the returned flashcards for the url: http://adamweisman.com/flashcards?limit=3 could be:

{
  "flashcards": [
    {
      "question": "1 x 0 = ?",
      "answer": "0"
    },
    {
      "question": "1 x 1 = ?",
      "answer": "1"
    },
    {
      "question": "1 x 2 = ?",
      "answer": "2"
    }
  ]
}

I created a github repo for this and invited you as a collaborator. Github is a good place to keep track of things.
